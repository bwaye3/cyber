INTRODUCTION
------------

Back To Top adds a button that hovers in the bottom of your screen and allow
users to smoothly scroll up the page. Back To Top have a nice easing effect
and also checks if you interact with the page (for example, scrolling or
clicking with the mouse), in which case the animation is canceled. Many other
scripts lock the screen or just teleport you to the top.
